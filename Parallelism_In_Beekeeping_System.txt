Parallelism and Threading in the Beekeeping Management System

The Beekeeping Management System utilizes parallel processing to improve performance when handling large datasets of hives and tasks. Parallelism is implemented in two main areas:

1. Hive Statistics Generation (ParallelHiveProcessor.java)
   - The generateHiveStatistics method divides hives into chunks and processes them concurrently
   - Uses ExecutorService with a thread pool to distribute work across multiple threads
   - Each thread processes a subset of hives and calculates statistics independently
   - Results from all threads are combined to produce final statistics
   - NOTE: Currently not actively used in the application but remains available for future use

2. Task Statistics Generation (ParallelTaskProcessor.java)
   - The generateTaskStatistics method splits tasks into chunks for concurrent processing
   - Employs ExecutorService with thread pool for parallel execution
   - Individual threads analyze task subsets and compute statistics separately
   - Aggregates results from all threads to generate comprehensive statistics
   - NOTE: Currently not actively used in the application but remains available for future use

Thread Safety Measures:
- DataManager uses ReentrantReadWriteLock to ensure thread-safe access to shared data
- ConcurrentHashMap is used for storing hives, tasks, users, and reports
- Proper synchronization prevents race conditions during data operations

Benefits:
- Improved performance when generating reports for large datasets
- Better utilization of multi-core processors
- Faster response times for administrative reporting features

Current Status:
The parallel processing components are implemented but not currently utilized in the main application flow. They remain in the codebase for potential future use or performance enhancements.
