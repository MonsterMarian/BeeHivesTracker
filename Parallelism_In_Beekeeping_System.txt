eping Management System utilizes parallel processing to improve performance when handling large datasets of hives and tasks. Parallelism is now actively implemented in the following areas:

1. Multithreaded Logging System (ActivityLogger.java)
   - Uses ExecutorService with a single-thread executor for handling log writes
   - Logging operations happen on a separate thread without blocking the main application flow
   - Implementation: Lines 11, 19, 27-31, 45-47, 70-72, 86-88, 111-125 in ActivityLogger.java
   - Prevents I/O operations from slowing down the main application

2. Parallel Data Loading During Login (LoginManager.java)
   - Uses CompletableFuture to start loading data in the background as soon as the login manager is instantiated
   - Data loading happens in parallel while the user is entering their credentials
   - Implementation: Lines 4, 13, 19, 28-31, 40-43, 52-56 in LoginManager.java
   - Uses CompletableFuture.runAsync() to execute data loading on a separate thread

3. Parallel Data Processing in DataManager (DataManager.java)
   - Modified loadDataFromFile() and reloadDataFromFile() methods to use parallel streams
   - Data processing uses parallelStream().forEach() which distributes work across multiple threads
   - Implementation: Lines 112-116, 220-224 in DataManager.java
   - Processes loaded hives, tasks, users, and reports using parallel streams for better performance

Thread Safety Measures:
- DataManager uses ReentrantReadWriteLock to ensure thread-safe access to shared data
- ConcurrentHashMap is used for storing hives, tasks, users, and reports
- Proper synchronization prevents race conditions during data operations
